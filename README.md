# What is Ghosting?
Ghosting is a term for moving about the court, usually by yourself, to work on your technique and/or fitness. Although 
we frequently only refer to "movement," it's crucial to understand that movement *is* technique. Swinging requires no 
different movement from your body than it does from your arm.

Ghosting doesn't have to be high intensity all the time, slower sessions that focus specifically on  *how* you move
around the court help build up muscle memory.

## The aim of this app
This app is designed to improve movement on the squash court, by providing randomised ghosting
patterns per time period, at different frequencies. The frequency is determined by the user, with three
different modes currently implemented (Easy, Medium and Hard).

The time interval is also determined by the user from a range of 15 seconds, up to  2 minutes and 15 seconds.

By having randomised patterns, these ghosting sessions can now also be more reaction based, better simulating the conditions
of a rally.

To add to this, a "Rally Type" selector has also been added. This allows for ghosting patterns to be unrestricted to the
whole of the court, but specific rally types have also been added:
- Backhand and Forehand rallies focus mainly on those areas, but the occasional shot in another area of the court will happen to keep the exercise reactive.
- Volleys only focus on the middle of the middle of the court.
- Short game only focuses in the front two corners of the court.
